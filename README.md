## Overview
The aim of this project is to provide an Apex Legends statistic tracker for all the players who would like to keep track of their in-game stats.

Nonetheless, there is not an Apex Legends official API yet, so we have to work with unnoficial API's that, despite being very welcomed by the community do have some limitations.


## How to display my data 
In order for the API to get players data, in-game banners must be added to each legend.

- STEP 1: Equip the following banners in one of your legends: Kills, Wins & Top3.
- STEP 2: Refresh your profile in <a href="https://apex-opgg.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">ApexOPGG</a>

- STEP 3: Repeat STEP 1 and 2 for each legend

CONGRATS! Your stats have been registered and will be automatically updated in the future!

As the API's for Apex improve, more statistics might be introduced.

## API Used
I encourage you to visit the <a href="https://github.com/HugoDerave/ApexLegendsAPI/">unofficial Apex Legends API</a> used for this project. 
Wider information about the functioning of the API can be found there. Let's give hime some love for creating the biggest Apex Legends API to date.
